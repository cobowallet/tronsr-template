## Tron Super Representatives Nodes

Cobo is contributing three Super Representatives
### Node 1.
Name: http://cobo.com
Address: TGnTYAB6XjLWoAGYXmDoLeLeX9X59JFBVK
Reward policy: If the node is elected to be a block producer, Cobo will return all the block producer incentives to the voters.

### Node 2.
TBD

### Node 3.
TBD

### Plan for hardware expansion
Every Tron Super representative node is runing in secure cloud center, across the world ( Japan, North America, China, and Europe). Initially, each Super Representative consistent with 3 main nodes and 1 backup node. Every server node will be 24/7 automatically monitored with real time operation alerts. We will make sure every server nodes are healthy, which means CPU utilization rate is below 45%, peak below 75%, memory and bandwidth utilization below 40% of each server. If the threshold exceed, we will upgrade server nodes, or add more server nodes with proper load balancing. 

Cobo designated two front-end engineer, two backend engineer and one senior site reliability engineer to support Tron Super Representatives, contribute to Tron community, actively develop TRX related tool chains, e,g, wallet, voting, etc.
